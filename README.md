# beat-aml_project
Supervised by Dr. Manjari Kiran (Assistant prof. SLS, UoH, India) this project is focused on Acute Myeloid Leukemia related drug resistance.

i.   The final aim of this project is to identify transcriptomic structural variants (TSV) of AML, that are associated with drug resistance in AML patients.
ii.  We also aim to understand the biology of any TSV adn their role in drug resistance.
iii. Also whether we can identify any new TSV from RNA seq data using SV identifying algorithms.
iv.  Finally we wish to compare the results from BEAT AML cohort with AML cohorts from TCGA.
